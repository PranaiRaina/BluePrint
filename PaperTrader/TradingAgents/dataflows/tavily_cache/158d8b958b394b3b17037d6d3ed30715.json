[...] ## Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings on Feb. 25\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2026 (ended in late January) results on Wednesday, Feb. 25, after the market close. (It generally releases its results at 4:20 p.m. ET, in my observation.) An earnings call with analysts is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET the same day.\n\nFor Q4, management guided for revenue of $65 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 65%. It also guided (albeit indirectly, through several inputs) for adjusted EPS of $1.50, representing 69% growth.\n\n## Read Next\n\n\u2022By Stefon Walters\n\nBetter Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir\n\n\u2022By Sean Williams\n\nNvidia and Palantir Are Sending a $12.8 Billion Ominous Warning to Wall Street -- but Are Investors Paying Attention?

That's because these companies are almost always Nvidia partners and/or customers \u2013 directly or indirectly.\n\nThis is the case with both Palantir Technologies (PLTR +6.85%) and Teradyne (TER +13.35%), which both reported great fourth-quarter results after the market close on Monday.
