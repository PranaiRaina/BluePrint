This financial discipline is one reason the company posted such strong earnings growth in its most recent quarter. Apple's earnings per share rose 19% year-over-year in fiscal Q1, outpacing social media company Meta Platforms, even though Meta's revenue rose 24% year-over-year during the holiday quarter (much faster than Apple's 16% growth); Meta's earnings rose only 11% year over year, weighed down by heavy spending.\n\n## NASDAQ: AAPL\n\nApple\n\nToday's Change\n\n(4.12%) $10.69\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$270.17\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$4.0T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$259.19- $270.49\n\n52wk Range [...] ## Key Points\n\n Greg Abel's new role as Berkshire Hathaway CEO comes with about $378 billion in cash and Treasury bills.\n Apple's fiscal first-quarter results were driven by a 23% year-over-year jump in iPhone revenue.\n I like the pairing of Apple's strong growth with Berkshire's optionality.\n\n## NASDAQ: AAPL\n\n### Apple\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$4.0T\n\nToday's Change\n\n(4.12%) $10.69\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$270.17\n\nPrice as ofFebruary 2, 2026 at 3:58 PMET\n\nApple's surging iPhone sales and Berkshire's $378 billion cash hoard make a nice pair as an anchor for my portfolio in 2026.

Consistently growing at double-digit rates, this high-margin segment should be a catalyst for Apple's earnings growth over the long haul.\n\nIn addition to each of these companies being good investments in their own right, they also offer a good mixture of offense and defense when paired together.", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.tipranks.com/news/openai-unveils-codex-app-for-use-with-apple-aapl-computers", "title": "OpenAI Unveils Codex App for Use with Apple (AAPL) Computers -
