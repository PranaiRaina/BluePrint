[...] \u201cWe are moving towards a day where generative AI and other smart tools will help our surface rovers handle kilometer-scale drives while minimizing operator workload and flag interesting surface features for our science team by scouring huge volumes of rover images,\u201d she added.\n\n## What\u2019s next for Perseverance?\n\nThis orbital image depicts the AI-planned (in magenta) and actual (orange) routes the Perseverance Mars rover took during its Dec. 10, 2025, drive at Jezero Crater. The drive was the second of two demonstrations incorporating generative AI into rover route planning. | Source: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nNASA said it hopes that the technology it has tested with Perseverance can have benefit many different areas. [...] Now, with Perseverance, NASA is trying something different. Generative AI analyzed the high-resolution orbital imagery from the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera aboard NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and terrain-slope data from digital elevation models.\n\nAfter identifying critical terrain features \u2014 bedrock, outcrops, hazardous boulder fields, sand ripples, and the like \u2014 it generated a continuous path complete with waypoints.\n\nTo ensure the AI\u2019s instructions were fully compatible with the rover\u2019s flight software, the engineering team also processed the drive commands through JPL\u2019s digital twin.

Developing a \u201cgeneral\u201d intelligence was a core reason DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI were founded. And not even two years ago, these CEOs had fairly similar forecasts that AGI would arrive by the late 2020s. Now the consensus is gone: Not only are the timelines scattered, but the broad agreement on what AGI even is and the immediate value it could provide humanity has been scrubbed away.\n\nRead: \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI\u201d [...] Technology\n\n# Do You Feel the AGI Yet?\n\nAccording to some predictions, 2026 is the year that an all-powerful AI will arrive.\n\nBy Matteo Wong\n\nHundreds of billions of dollars have been poured into the AI industry in pursuit of a loosely defined goal: artificial general intelligence, a system powerful enough to perform at least as well as a human at any task that involves thinking. Will this be the year it finally arrives? [...] Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and xAI CEO Elon Musk think so. Both have said that such a system could go online by the end of 2026, bringing, perhaps, cancer cures or novel bioweapons. (Amodei says he prefers the term powerful AI to AGI, because the latter is overhyped.) But wait: Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says we might wait another decade for AGI. And\u2014hold on\u2014OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview last month that \u201cAGI kind of went whooshing by\u201d already; that now he\u2019s focused instead on \u201csuperintelligence,\u201d which he defines as an AI system that can do better at specific, highly demanding jobs (\u201cbeing president of the United States\u201d or \u201cCEO of a major company\u201d) than any person could, even if that person were aided by AI themselves.", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://aviationweek.com/defense/aircraft-propulsion/wheres-military-ai-headed-2030", "title": "Where\u2019s Military AI Headed In 2030? - Aviation Week Network", "score": 0.13117322, "published_date": "Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:44:58 GMT", "content": "## Share\n\nRobert Wall February 04, 2026\n\nSINGAPORE\u2014The adoption of artificial intelligence will by 2030 have moved from an ambition to a reality, industry officials said here at the Singapore Airshow.\n\n\u201cIn 2030 I think we won't be having a discussion like today, where autonomy is something that we want to add on. I think autonomy and AI will just be baseline,\u201d said Jason Levin, Anduril's senior vice president for engineering. \u201cAnd I think the people that don't realize that are going to get left behind,\u201d he said during an autonomy panel on Feb. 4 at the Singapore Airshow.\n\nShield AI President Brandon Tseng was even more bullish. \u201cI think by 2030 the top 25 militaries in the world will have announced that they're building 1 million-plus drone armies,\u201d he said at the event. [...] Absent the adoption of artificial intelligence technology, deploying forces at that scale would not be possible, he argued. \u201cYou can field 20 million drones. You can't build 20 million drone pilots. You need those AI pilots to unlock that capability.\u201d\n\nThales Chief Technology Officer Bernhard Quendt said the adoption of AI technology has already started and will only accelerate. In 2030, the issue will be more that new disruptive technologies like quantum will start to appear.\n\nRobert Wall\n\nRobert Wall is Executive Editor for Defense and Space.
