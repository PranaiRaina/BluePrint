The system isn\u2019t perfect, though, as manufacturers like Samsung have had delays that they eventually rectified. Users are now reporting more weirdness around Google Play System Updates, as it seems the newest update is downgrading users from the January 2026 GPSU to the November 2025 GPSU.\n\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n\n Set us as a favorite source in Google Discover to never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\n You can also set us as a preferred source in Google Search by clicking the button below. [...] Several Google Pixel owners are reporting (1, 2, 3) that they were on the January 1, 2026, Google Play System Update, but received a notification for an update. After updating, they were weirdly back down to the November 1, 2025 Google Play System Update.\n\nWhile the reports are primarily from Pixel users across both the stable and beta release branches, the issue is Pixel-agnostic. Android Authority contributor AssembleDebug also noticed that their OnePlus 13R went through the same charade: Applying an \u201cupdate\u201d to the January 2026 GPSU dropped it back to November 2025 GPSU.\n\nGoogle recently made it easier to uninstall Google Play System Updates. When AssembleDebug uninstalled the November 2025 GPSU, they were back to the January 2026 GPSU! [...] Rita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR\n\n Users are reporting that the latest Google Play system update reverts their version from January 2026 to November 2025.\n Reports are largely from Google Pixel users, but the issue affects phones from other Android brands too.\n The \u201cdowngrade\u201d may be a mislabeled February 2026 update, and users are advised to stay on the latest available version for now.", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://videocardz.com/newz/geforce-rtx-5090-turns-one-now-costs-nearly-twice-the-msrp", "title": "GeForce RTX 5090 turns one, now costs nearly twice the MSRP - VideoCardz.com", "score": 0.115730874, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:18:00 GMT", "content": "At retail, pricing has drifted far from anything official. The lowest in-stock listing we could find was the MSI RTX 5090 Liquid at $3,699, sold by Newegg. Other stores either show no stock at all or list placeholder prices that do not reflect real availability. This has become the normal state rather than a temporary spike.\n\n### Crypto, COVID and AI, new GPUs can\u2019t catch a break\n\nThere is also little reason to expect a late-cycle correction. With next-generation GPUs now expected around mid-2027, the window for prices to settle is short. Demand from the AI sector has not eased, and the market is now dealing with a DRAM shortage crisis that pushes costs in the opposite direction.

One era had crypto. Another had COVID-era supply limits. This one has AI demand and memory constraints. Unfortunately, writing about graphics cards while knowing that many gamers cannot afford them does not give us much joy.\n\nStill, we stay hopeful that this card will return to MSRP by the end of the RTX 50 series. We also hope graphics cards will not face another nemesis in 2027. The RTX 5090 launched on January 30 with an official price of $1,999. One year later, that number exists mostly on paper.\n\n  \n\nFollow us on Google News   Set as Preferred Source \n\nShare\n\n#### Popular Stories", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://videocardz.com/newz/samsung-says-its-2026-oled-tvs-and-odyssey-monitors-are-now-nvidia-g-sync-compatible", "title": "Samsung says its 2026 OLED TVs and Odyssey monitors are now NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible - VideoCardz.com", "score": 0.09000516, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:26:00 GMT", "content": "Hide Comment Policy\n\nComments\n\nLoading comments...\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPHILIPS launches EVNIA 27M2N5500XD: the world\u2019s first 1000Hz Dual-Mode gaming monitor with DP 2.1 UBHR20\n\nJan 31 Xiaomi\u2019s G Pro 27Qi 2026 gaming monitor goes global with 2000-nit Mini LED HDR and 180Hz\n\nJan 31 GIGABYTE says it is expanding its AMD partnership and introducing new X870E X3D motherboards, Ryzen AI 400 laptops, and FreeSync OLED monitors.\n\nJan 29 ASUS ROG Swift PG27AQWP-W preorders go live at $1,099: 540Hz QHD OLED with 720Hz dual mode\n\nJan 21 ASUS ProArt displays add Mac-focused color sync and on-device profile storage\n\nJan 20\n\nLatest Stories\n\nPuget Systems reliability data shows Core Ultra 200 and Ryzen 9000 X3D with near-identical failure rates [...] Feb 02 Core UItra 9 290K Plus \u201cArrow Lake Refresh\u201d CPU leaks again, now 10% faster than 285K\n\nFeb 02 Samsung says its 2026 OLED TVs and Odyssey monitors are now NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible\n\nFeb 02 GeForce RTX 5090 turns one, now costs nearly twice the MSRP\n\nFeb 02 ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X mod pushes memory to 64GB capacity\n\nFeb 02\n\nMost Popular\n\nGeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and even 5060 Ti are now sold in blower-style designs for AI farms\n\nJan 10 Amazon buyer unboxes \u201cRTX 5080\u201d with a single 8-pin connector, which turns out to be 5060 Ti\n\nJan 20 Russian modder makes his own DDR5 memory saving $600 to $800 on single module\n\nJan 10 New 240p/360p resolution tests show what DLSS 4.5 can rebuild from almost nothing [...] Samsung Electronics says the 2026 OLED TV range and its next Odyssey gaming monitors are certified as NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible.

Adjusted EPS soared 89% year over year to $1.80, crushing the $1.38 Wall Street had expected.\n\nCEO Greg Smith said, \"In 2026, we expect year-over-year growth across all of our businesses, with strong momentum in compute driven by AI.\"\n\nTeradyne stock rocketed 13.4% on Tuesday.\n\n## Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings on Feb. 25 [...] ## Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings on Feb. 25\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2026 (ended in late January) results on Wednesday, Feb. 25, after the market close. (It generally releases its results at 4:20 p.m. ET, in my observation.) An earnings call with analysts is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET the same day.\n\nFor Q4, management guided for revenue of $65 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 65%. It also guided (albeit indirectly, through several inputs) for adjusted EPS of $1.50, representing 69% growth.\n\n## Read Next\n\n\u2022By Stefon Walters\n\nBetter Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir\n\n\u2022By Sean Williams\n\nNvidia and Palantir Are Sending a $12.8 Billion Ominous Warning to Wall Street -- but Are Investors Paying Attention?", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-says-steam-machine-is-on-track-to-ship-early-this-year-and-xbox-2027-soc-work-is-progressing", "title": "AMD says Steam Machine is on track to ship early this year, and Xbox 2027 SoC work is progressing - VideoCardz.com", "score": 0.086701825, "published_date": "Wed, 04 Feb 2026 08:12:00 GMT", "content": "Leak chatter has linked the next-gen Xbox chip to Zen 6 and Zen 6c CPU cores and an RDNA 5 GPU, often under the \u201cMagnus\u201d label.
