(It generally releases its results at 4:20 p.m. ET, in my observation.) An earnings call with analysts is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET the same day.\n\nFor Q4, management guided for revenue of $65 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 65%. It also guided (albeit indirectly, through several inputs) for adjusted EPS of $1.50, representing 69% growth.\n\n## Read Next\n\n\u2022By Stefon Walters\n\nBetter Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir\n\n\u2022By Sean Williams\n\nNvidia and Palantir Are Sending a $12.8 Billion Ominous Warning to Wall Street -- but Are Investors Paying Attention?

Adjusted EPS soared 89% year over year to $1.80, crushing the $1.38 Wall Street had expected.\n\nCEO Greg Smith said, \"In 2026, we expect year-over-year growth across all of our businesses, with strong momentum in compute driven by AI.\"\n\nTeradyne stock rocketed 13.4% on Tuesday.\n\n## Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings on Feb. 25", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://videocardz.com/newz/samsung-says-its-2026-oled-tvs-and-odyssey-monitors-are-now-nvidia-g-sync-compatible", "title": "Samsung says its 2026 OLED TVs and Odyssey monitors are now NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible - VideoCardz.com", "score": 0.1634591, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:26:00 GMT", "content": "Hide Comment Policy\n\nComments\n\nLoading comments...\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPHILIPS launches EVNIA 27M2N5500XD: the world\u2019s first 1000Hz Dual-Mode gaming monitor with DP 2.1 UBHR20\n\nJan 31 Xiaomi\u2019s G Pro 27Qi 2026 gaming monitor goes global with 2000-nit Mini LED HDR and 180Hz\n\nJan 31 GIGABYTE says it is expanding its AMD partnership and introducing new X870E X3D motherboards, Ryzen AI 400 laptops, and FreeSync OLED monitors.\n\nJan 29 ASUS ROG Swift PG27AQWP-W preorders go live at $1,099: 540Hz QHD OLED with 720Hz dual mode\n\nJan 21 ASUS ProArt displays add Mac-focused color sync and on-device profile storage\n\nJan 20\n\nLatest Stories\n\nPuget Systems reliability data shows Core Ultra 200 and Ryzen 9000 X3D with near-identical failure rates [...] Feb 02 Core UItra 9 290K Plus \u201cArrow Lake Refresh\u201d CPU leaks again, now 10% faster than 285K\n\nFeb 02 Samsung says its 2026 OLED TVs and Odyssey monitors are now NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible\n\nFeb 02 GeForce RTX 5090 turns one, now costs nearly twice the MSRP\n\nFeb 02 ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X mod pushes memory to 64GB capacity\n\nFeb 02\n\nMost Popular\n\nGeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and even 5060 Ti are now sold in blower-style designs for AI farms\n\nJan 10 Amazon buyer unboxes \u201cRTX 5080\u201d with a single 8-pin connector, which turns out to be 5060 Ti\n\nJan 20 Russian modder makes his own DDR5 memory saving $600 to $800 on single module\n\nJan 10 New 240p/360p resolution tests show what DLSS 4.5 can rebuild from almost nothing [...] Share\n\n#### Popular Stories\n\nGeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and even 5060 Ti are now sold in blower-style designs for AI farms Amazon buyer unboxes \u201cRTX 5080\u201d with a single 8-pin connector, which turns out to be 5060 Ti Russian modder makes his own DDR5 memory saving $600 to $800 on single module New 240p/360p resolution tests show what DLSS 4.5 can rebuild from almost nothing Japanese retailer will buy almost any used gaming PC as new and used systems get harder to find Steam Machine shows up at first retailers, but the price looks like a placeholder Refunded GeForce RTX 5080 still arrives, Amazon tells buyer to keep it German retailer claims it can\u2019t sell RTX 5090, RTX 5080, or RTX 5070 Ti due to \u201ccurrent market conditions\u201d", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://in.ign.com/tech/252225/news/nvidia-releases-a-new-update-for-its-gpu-display-driver-addressing-three-high-severity-security-vuln", "title": "Nvidia Releases a New Update for Its GPU Display Driver Addressing Three 'High' Severity Security Vulnerabilities - IGN India", "score": 0.12651539, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:40:00 GMT", "content": "Technology\n\n# Nvidia Releases a New Update for Its GPU Display Driver Addressing Three 'High' Severity Security Vulnerabilities\n\n### The latest update also fixes a VGPU software issue of \"High\" severity.\n\nBy Yashodhan Naidu\n\nUpdated: Feb. 3, 2026, 8:28 a.m.\n\nRelated reads:Nvidia: Here Is Why I Chose Team Green and How DLSS 4.5 and Its 2nd Gen Transformer Model Changed My Gaming Experience\n\nNvidia has rolled out a new software security update for its GPU display driver, which takes care of three vulnerabilities, labelled as \u201chigh\u201d severity.

The lowest in-stock listing we could find was the MSI RTX 5090 Liquid at $3,699, sold by Newegg. Other stores either show no stock at all or list placeholder prices that do not reflect real availability. This has become the normal state rather than a temporary spike.\n\n### Crypto, COVID and AI, new GPUs can\u2019t catch a break\n\nThere is also little reason to expect a late-cycle correction. With next-generation GPUs now expected around mid-2027, the window for prices to settle is short. Demand from the AI sector has not eased, and the market is now dealing with a DRAM shortage crisis that pushes costs in the opposite direction.
