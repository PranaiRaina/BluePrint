Adjusted EPS soared 89% year over year to $1.80, crushing the $1.38 Wall Street had expected.\n\nCEO Greg Smith said, \"In 2026, we expect year-over-year growth across all of our businesses, with strong momentum in compute driven by AI.\"\n\nTeradyne stock rocketed 13.4% on Tuesday.\n\n## Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings on Feb. 25", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nvidia-stock-gets-major-reality-check-on-100b-number", "title": "Nvidia stock gets major reality check on \u2018$100B\u2019 number - thestreet.com", "score": 0.49729064, "published_date": "Tue, 03 Feb 2026 03:07:00 GMT", "content": "From its 10-Q:\n\n Nvidia repurchased 70M shares for $12.6 billion in Q3 FY26.\n Nvidia repurchased 262M shares for $36.7 billion in the first nine months of FY26.\n It was authorized to repurchase up to $62.2 billion more, as of Oct. 26, 2025.\n\nSo here\u2019s the true stock angle. If Nvidia can continue to buy back shares on a large scale while simultaneously supporting the ecosystem, it strengthens the \u201cAI cash engine\u201d story on which the multiple is based.\n\n## What would actually move NVDA stock from here\n\nNVDA stock requires tangible catalysts rather than just positive sentiment. This includes three main drivers. [...] The market valuation of NVDA was around $4.64T at the end of the day on Jan. 31.\n Trailing P/E is at 53.81, and forward P/E is about 29.94 (Yahoo Finance key metrics).\n\nAt that multiple, the market wants growth and ecosystem financing to stop \u201cpulling forward\u201d growth; that is the current concern about Big Tech expenditures.\n\nTheStreet Newsletters\n\nGet the latest in market trends or guidance on simple ways to grow your wealth.\n\nor sign in with\n\nBy signing up I agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge that I have read the Privacy Policy.

[...] Regardless of your personal opinion, the standard mega-cap argument is no longer valid, with the tech giant now firmly in the perpetual AI capex machine space. This means any issues with OpenAI will lead to a sharp hit in the sentiment.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang swooped in, though, saving the day with some sharp statements in Taipei.\n\n\u201cNo, no, nothing like that,\u201d he said, when asked if the investment would be more than $100 billion.\n\nWhat does that mean for traders? It means, very simply, Nvidia is saying it will help pay for one of the world\u2019s top consumers of AI computing, even if it is already guiding to $65 billion quarters.\n\n## The Nvidia stock angle investors should anchor to\n\nNVDA is now trading at a price that requires clear confirmation that \u201cAI demand stays hot.\u201d", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2026/02/03/can-ai-demand-drive-nvda-stock-to-240/", "title": "Can AI Demand Drive NVDA Stock To $240? - Forbes", "score": 0.47489962, "published_date": "Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:11:28 GMT", "content": "PROMOTED\n\nLet\u2019s delve into details of each of the assessed factors, but before that, for quick background: With $4.5 Tril in market capitalization, NVIDIA provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions for the gaming, visualization, datacenter, and automotive industries globally, with a strategic partnership with Kroger Co.\n\n Valuation Appears Very High\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Bill Clinton And Hillary Clinton Agree To Testify On Jeffrey Epstein After Rejecting Subpoenas\n\n### WWE Raw Results (Feb. 2, 2026), Winners, Highlights And Grades, Winners, Highlights And Grades\")\n\n### Another Daytime Exit: \u2018Sherri,\u2019 Hosted By Sherri Shepherd, To End Syndication Run\n\nThis table illustrates how NVDA is valued compared to the broader market.
