Here are the details.\n\n## Older iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch models get new software updates\n\nPer Aaron Perris, Apple has released the following new software updates:\n\n iOS 16.7.14 (build 20H370)\n iPadOS 16.7.14 (build 20H370)\n macOS 11.7.11 (build 20G1443)\n watchOS 10.6.2 (build 21U594)\n watchOS 9.6.4 (build 20U512)\n watchOS 6.3.1 (build 17U224)\n macOS Catalina Security Update 2026-001\n\nThese releases are all for older versions of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch software. [...] iOS 16.7.14, as noted here, addresses an issue that was discovered in the prior iOS 16.7.13 release. Apple shipped that update last week but ultimately pulled it when network connectivity issues in Australia were discovered.\n\nHowever, the new updates for macOS and watchOS are a bit of a surprise.\n\nPer Apple\u2019s online support documents, they appear to be focused on extending iMessage, FaceTime, and device activation certifications on older devices.\n\nFrom Apple\u2019s website regarding the Big Sur update:\n\n> This update extends the certification required by features such as iMessage, FaceTime, and device activation to continue working after January 2027.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you posted on any additional software updates that may arrive, or new details on this latest lineup of releases.", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/03/apple-hosts-apple-tv-media-event-heres-everything-thats-been-announced/", "title": "Apple hosts Apple TV media event, here\u2019s everything that\u2019s been announced - 9to5Mac", "score": 0.15529642, "published_date": "Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:01:03 GMT", "content": "Go to the 9to5Mac home page\n\n Apple TV\n\n# Apple hosts Apple TV media event, here\u2019s everything that\u2019s been announced\n\nRyan Christoffel | Feb 3 2026 - 12:01 pm PT\n\n0 Comments\n\nApple is hosting a special media event today called the \u20182026 Apple TV Press Day.\u2019 Here\u2019s everything that\u2019s been announced at the event so far.\n\n## Apple unveils new original TV shows and movies coming soon\n\nToday in Santa Monica, California, Apple is hosting a major invite-only media event focused on its streaming service.\n\nIn attendance are a variety of current and future Apple TV stars, such as Jon Hamm, Anya Taylor-Joy, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Garner, Keanu Reeves, James Marsden, and more.\n\n\u20182026 Apple TV Press Day\u2019 has brought unveilings of several new original TV shows and movies.
