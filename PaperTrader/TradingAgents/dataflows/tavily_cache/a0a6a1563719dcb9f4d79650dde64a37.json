And can third-party developers monetize spatial experiences if the install base fragments between premium headsets and lighter glasses? Suppliers may face canceled or delayed orders, while startups pitching companion apps could win fresh attention. If you build for AR, re-scope roadmaps now.\n\n## What this shift means for early adopters and Apple\u2019s AR plans in 2026? [...] Apple launched Vision Pro at $3,499, and subsequent software pushes-like visionOS 26-aimed to boost value but didn\u2019t erase adoption barriers. Media coverage through mid-2025 showed slow consumer traction, prompting Apple to prioritize smaller, AI-enabled glasses. The strategic shift leans on software (Apple Intelligence) rather than aggressive hardware upgrades.\n\nSee also  \"Smart Move, Just Late\" Sparks Alarm Over 30% Metaverse Cuts In 2025 - Here's Why\n\n## The numbers that change the game for Vision Pro in 2025\n\n| KPI | Value + Unit | Change/Impact |\n --- \n| Launch price | $3,499 | Limited consumer uptake vs mass-market devices |\n| Overhaul pause date | Oct 1, 2025 | Resources redirected toward AI glasses |\n| visionOS update | April 2025 | Apple Intelligence added, software focus grew | [...] ## What changes for developers and buyers after Apple\u2019s 2025 pivot\n\n> \u2022 Apple paused the Vision Pro overhaul on Oct 1, 2025; resources moved to AI glasses.\n>\n> \u2022 visionOS 26 added Apple Intelligence in April 2025; software updates increased Vision Pro capabilities.\n>\n> \u2022 Bloomberg and Reuters reported the pause; enterprise roadmap now prioritizes compact AR products.\n\n## Why Apple\u2019s 2025 Vision Pro shift accelerates the race to AR glasses", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-studio-display-2-rumored-features/", "title": "Apple's Studio Display 2 Reportedly on Track to Launch This Year With These New Features - MacRumors", "score": 0.0946777, "published_date": "Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:46:58 GMT", "content": "Saturday January 31, 2026 10:51 am PST by Joe Rossignol\n\nApple recently updated its online store with a new ordering process for Macs, including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro.
