It also guided (albeit indirectly, through several inputs) for adjusted EPS of $1.50, representing 69% growth.\n\n## Read Next\n\n\u2022By Stefon Walters\n\nBetter Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir\n\n\u2022By Sean Williams\n\nNvidia and Palantir Are Sending a $12.8 Billion Ominous Warning to Wall Street -- but Are Investors Paying Attention?

[...] As per the announcement, the first high-severity issue was for Windows users, where \u201can attacker could trigger a use after free.\u201d If the attacker succeeded, then it could lead to \u201ccode execution, escalation of privileges, data tampering, denial of service, and information disclosure.\u201d\n\nThe second high-severity issue was once again for Windows users, but this time, in the \u201ckernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys), where an attacker could cause an integer overflow.\u201d If the attacker succeeded, then it could result in the above-listed issues. The third high-severity issue was for Linux users, with the vulnerability being in the \u201cNVIDIA kernel module where an attacker could cause an integer overflow or wraparound.\u201d\n\nA successful exploit in this would have also resulted in the above-mentioned issues.", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://videocardz.com/newz/samsung-says-its-2026-oled-tvs-and-odyssey-monitors-are-now-nvidia-g-sync-compatible", "title": "Samsung says its 2026 OLED TVs and Odyssey monitors are now NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible - VideoCardz.com", "score": 0.30735803, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:26:00 GMT", "content": "Feb 02 Core UItra 9 290K Plus \u201cArrow Lake Refresh\u201d CPU leaks again, now 10% faster than 285K\n\nFeb 02 Samsung says its 2026 OLED TVs and Odyssey monitors are now NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible\n\nFeb 02 GeForce RTX 5090 turns one, now costs nearly twice the MSRP\n\nFeb 02 ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X mod pushes memory to 64GB capacity\n\nFeb 02\n\nMost Popular\n\nGeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and even 5060 Ti are now sold in blower-style designs for AI farms\n\nJan 10 Amazon buyer unboxes \u201cRTX 5080\u201d with a single 8-pin connector, which turns out to be 5060 Ti\n\nJan 20 Russian modder makes his own DDR5 memory saving $600 to $800 on single module\n\nJan 10 New 240p/360p resolution tests show what DLSS 4.5 can rebuild from almost nothing [...] Jan 13 Japanese retailer will buy almost any used gaming PC as new and used systems get harder to find\n\nJan 11 [...] Previous Post   \n GeForce RTX 5090 turns one, now costs nearly twice the MSRP  Next Post    \n Core UItra 9 290K Plus \"Arrow Lake Refresh\" CPU leaks again, now 10% faster than 285K\n\nComment Policy", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://videocardz.com/newz/geforce-rtx-5090-turns-one-now-costs-nearly-twice-the-msrp", "title": "GeForce RTX 5090 turns one, now costs nearly twice the MSRP - VideoCardz.com", "score": 0.09602549, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:18:00 GMT", "content": "Feb 02 Core UItra 9 290K Plus \u201cArrow Lake Refresh\u201d CPU leaks again, now 10% faster than 285K\n\nFeb 02 Samsung says its 2026 OLED TVs and Odyssey monitors are now NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible\n\nFeb 02 GeForce RTX 5090 turns one, now costs nearly twice the MSRP\n\nFeb 02 ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X mod pushes memory to 64GB capacity\n\nFeb 02\n\nMost Popular\n\nGeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and even 5060 Ti are now sold in blower-style designs for AI farms\n\nJan 10 Amazon buyer unboxes \u201cRTX 5080\u201d with a single 8-pin connector, which turns out to be 5060 Ti\n\nJan 20 Russian modder makes his own DDR5 memory saving $600 to $800 on single module\n\nJan 10 New 240p/360p resolution tests show what DLSS 4.5 can rebuild from almost nothing [...] ### MSRP but not really\n\nCurrently, there are two realistic ways to get close to MSRP. One is an invite to the verified priority access program. Those invites appear infrequently, in fact, I don\u2019t recall the last time I saw an user bragging about an invite. The other is buying directly from NVIDIA through its own web stores, but those drops have been scarce. Over the past two months, buyers had a combined total of about eight minutes to purchase a Founders Edition card at list price. At least that\u2019s true for some EU countries.
