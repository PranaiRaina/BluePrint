Apple TV is also making a bigger push into live sports with moves like its deal with Formula 1, which starts this year. (Notably absent from these lists: just what the heck is going on with The Savant?) [...] Given that one of the persistent complaints with regards to Apple TV is a lack of things to watch, which is likely one of the reasons it sits distantly behind its streaming competitors, this slate of announcements seems designed specifically to address that. However, the lineup does raise questions as to whether Apple can keep up the level of quality that\u2019s expected of it spread across so many projects. Matchbox: The Movie doesn\u2019t inspire a lot of hope; then again, Apple\u2019s movie offering have always felt a step or two behind its TV shows.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\n\n Andrew Webster\n\n## Most Popular\n\nMost Popular", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/02/apple-releases-mac-watch-certificate-updates/", "title": "Apple Releases macOS 11, watchOS 10, and watchOS 9 Updates to Keep iMessage and FaceTime Working on Older Devices - MacRumors", "score": 0.29421496, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 18:41:43 GMT", "content": "HomePod mini\n\nEarly 2026?\n\nFaster chips and new colors expected.\n\n\u2022 Low-Cost MacBook\n\n\u2022 MacBook Air\n\n\u2022 MacBook Pro\n\n\u2022 Studio Display\n\n\u2022 Mac mini\n\n\u2022 Mac Studio\n\n\u2022 iPhone 18 Pro\n\n\u2022 Foldable iPhone\n\nSee full product calendar\n\n## Other Stories\n\niPhone 18 Pro Launching Later This Year With These 12 New Features\n\n23 hours ago by Joe Rossignol\n\nApple's Next Launch is 'Imminent'\n\n2 days ago by Joe Rossignol\n\nTesla Reportedly Still Planning to Offer Apple CarPlay\n\n2 days ago by Joe Rossignol\n\nWhy Apple Just Updated an iPhone From 2013\n\n6 days ago by Tim Hardwick\n\nApple's Next Launch is Today\n\n6 days ago by Joe Rossignol [...] On the Mac, the update can be installed through the Settings app, while on the Apple Watch, the updates can be installed through the Apple Watch app on iPhone.\n\nwatchOS 9.6.4 and the update that preceded it are the final versions of watchOS that support devices like the \u200ciPhone\u200c 8, \u200ciPhone\u200c 8 Plus, and \u200ciPhone\u200c X, which are limited to iOS 16 and cannot be updated to iOS 17. watchOS 10.6.2 is available for the Apple Watch Series 4, Apple Watch Series 5, and the original Apple Watch SE.\n\nUpdate: Apple has also released macOS Catalina Security Update 2026-001 and watchOS 6.3.1 for older devices.\n\n [30 comments ]\n\n## Popular Stories\n\n### Apple's CarPlay Ultra to Expand to These Vehicle Brands Later This Year\n\nSunday February 1, 2026 10:08 am PST by Joe Rossignol [...] iPhone 17 vs iPhone 17 Pro vs iPhone Air\n\nApple's four new iPhones feature more differences between the latest models than ever before, so which one should you buy?\n\n\u2022 Apple Intelligence Guide\n\n\u2022 Image Playground Guide\n\n\u2022 iPhone Mirroring Not Working?\n\n\u2022 21 Time-Saving iPhone Tips\n\n\u2022 14 macOS Tips to Make Your Life Easier\n\n\u2022 One AirPod Not Working?\n\nSee more guides\n\n## Upcoming\n\niPhone 17e\n\nEarly 2026\n\nA19 chip, MagSafe, and perhaps a Dynamic Island instead of a display notch.\n\nApple TV\n\nEarly 2026?\n\nUpgrade to A17 or newer chip with Apple Intelligence support, plus Apple's new N1 wireless networking chip.\n\nSmart Home Hub\n\nEarly 2026?\n\nSquarish 7-inch screen for controlling smart home products, listening to music, making video calls, and more.\n\nHomePod mini\n\nEarly 2026?", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://deadline.com/2026/02/apple-2026-film-tv-slate-press-day-1236707518/", "title": "Apple Shows Off 2026 Film & TV Slate At Flashy, Tightly Curated Los Angeles Press Day - Deadline", "score": 0.27512974, "published_date": "Wed, 04 Feb 2026 01:59:53 GMT", "content": "Truthfully, attendees were buzzing before the panels even began, thanks to a swanky breakfast that welcomed guests with a set of new Airpods Pro to experience the latest iteration of the wireless headphones\u2019 live translation technology.

Fox as Gerry, a Parkinson\u2019s patient who meets Paul (Harrison Ford) at their shared doctor\u2019s office. Co-creators Bill Lawrence, Brett Goldstein and Jason Segel were MIA. Not much news out of that one, but to be fair the series did just get renewed for Season 4 ahead of the Season 3 premiere last week.\n\nSpeaking of this crew, nothing on Tuesday from one of Apple\u2019s biggest shows, Ted Lasso, even though that\u2019s slated to return with Season 4 this summer.
