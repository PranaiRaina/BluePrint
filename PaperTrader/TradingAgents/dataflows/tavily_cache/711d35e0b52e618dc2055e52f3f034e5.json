This financial discipline is one reason the company posted such strong earnings growth in its most recent quarter. Apple's earnings per share rose 19% year-over-year in fiscal Q1, outpacing social media company Meta Platforms, even though Meta's revenue rose 24% year-over-year during the holiday quarter (much faster than Apple's 16% growth); Meta's earnings rose only 11% year over year, weighed down by heavy spending.\n\n## NASDAQ: AAPL\n\nApple\n\nToday's Change\n\n(4.12%) $10.69\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$270.17\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$4.0T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$259.19- $270.49\n\n52wk Range [...] While earnings from Berkshire's insurance business are somewhat cyclical and difficult to predict, I believe the conglomerate is well-positioned to grow this core business and, of course, its earnings and book value over time.\n\n## Apple\n\nLike Berkshire, shares of the iPhone maker have declined slightly year to date as well. The stock is down about 3% as of this writing.\n\nYet Apple's latest earnings report, released last week, shows a major growth story.\n\nThe tech giant reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $143.8 billion, up 16% year over year, and its earnings per share rose 19% year over year. The quarter was driven by huge growth in iPhone revenue. iPhone revenue increased 23% year over year.

Accounting for about 25% of Apple's fiscal 2025 revenue, this is the company's second-biggest segment after iPhone. Consistently growing at double-digit rates, this high-margin segment should be a catalyst for Apple's earnings growth over the long haul.\n\nIn addition to each of these companies being good investments in their own right, they also offer a good mixture of offense and defense when paired together.", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://au.investing.com/news/company-news/tesla-urges-congress-to-update-selfdriving-regulations-93CH-4238399", "title": "Tesla urges Congress to update self-driving regulations By Investing.com - Investing.com Australia", "score": 0.3283684, "published_date": "Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:08:08 GMT", "content": "New Zealand 10Y\n\n4.63\n\n-0.023\n\n-0.49%\n\nU.S. 10Y\n\n4.285\n\n+0.008\n\n+0.19%\n\nJapan 10Y\n\n2.258\n\n+0.023\n\n+1.03%\n\nChina 10Y\n\n1.809\n\n0.000\n\n0.00%\n\nSingapore 10Y\n\n2.086\n\n+0.014\n\n+0.68%\n\nCSL\n\n178.11\n\n+1.03\n\n+0.58%\n\nWOW\n\n31.01\n\n+0.100\n\n+0.32%\n\nANZ\n\n36.78\n\n+0.030\n\n+0.08%\n\nCBA\n\n153.08\n\n+1.600\n\n+1.06%\n\nTLS\n\n4.89\n\n-0.020\n\n-0.41%\n\nNAB\n\n43.04\n\n+0.080\n\n+0.19%\n\nBHP\n\n50.13\n\n+0.710\n\n+1.44%\n\nMost Popular Articles\n\nNews\n\nAnalysis\n\nGlobal stock index up slightly while gold, silver bounce\n\nBy Reuters\n\n03 Feb 2026\n\nGold could crash 99.9% in worst-case scenario, this strategist says\n\nBy Investing.co...\n\n02 Feb 2026\n\nFTSE 100 today: UK stocks close lower, pound firm; AI fears hit publisher stocks\n\nBy Investing.co...\n\n03 Feb 2026\n\nNvidia stock muted as OpenAI seeks AI chip rivals\n\nBy Investing.co...\n\n02 Feb 2026 [...] By Investing.co...\n\n02 Feb 2026\n\nGold set for biggest daily gain since 2008 as investors rush back after selloff\n\nBy Reuters\n\n02 Feb 2026\n\n7 Deeply Oversold Stocks Entering February With Rebound Potential\n\nBy David Wagner\n\n02 Feb 2026\n\n1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Alphabet, Strategy\n\nBy Jesse Cohen\n\n31 Jan 2026\n\nSilver Flash Crash and What It Means for Gold Stocks\n\nBy Gary Tanashi...\n\n01 Feb 2026\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Power Grid Reality Check That Just Wiped Out $357 Billion\n\nBy Luis Flavio ...\n\n30 Jan 2026\n\nGold\u2019s Fate Now Hinges on the Dollar and US Data After Friday\u2019s Shock\n\nBy Fawad Razaqz...\n\n01 Feb 2026\n\nMore News\n\nMarket Movers", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.tipranks.com/news/smci-stock-braces-for-q2-earnings-analysts-cautious-options-eye-12-swing", "title": "SMCI Stock Braces for Q2 Earnings \u2013 Analysts Cautious, Options Eye 12% Swing - TipRanks", "score": 0.26755393, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 20:22:00 GMT", "content": "Shalu Saraf3h ago\n\nGOOGL](/news/alphabet-googl-will-report-q4-earnings-on-february-4-here-is-what-to-expect \"GOOGL\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### AI Is Driving Smartphone Prices Higher, and Memory Chipmakers Are the Real Winners\n\nRan Melamed3h ago\n\nMUAAPL](/news/ai-driven-memory-shortage-pushes-smartphone-prices-up-25-in-2026 \"MU | AAPL | DELL | MSFT | NVDA | GOOGL | SSNLF | LNVGY\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### OpenAI Unveils Codex App for Use with Apple (AAPL) Computers\n\nJoel Baglole4h ago\n\nAAPL](/news/openai-unveils-codex-app-for-use-with-apple-aapl-computers \"AAPL\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### Quantum Computing News: Defense Spending, IBM\u2019s Hybrid Push, and Quantum\u2019s First Step Into Wall Street\n\nRan Melamed4h ago", "raw_content": null}], "response_time": 1.22, "request_id": "1837dc1c-6e0e-4d1d-9f30-658dcd1b6a79"}
