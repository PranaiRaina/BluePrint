This financial discipline is one reason the company posted such strong earnings growth in its most recent quarter. Apple's earnings per share rose 19% year-over-year in fiscal Q1, outpacing social media company Meta Platforms, even though Meta's revenue rose 24% year-over-year during the holiday quarter (much faster than Apple's 16% growth); Meta's earnings rose only 11% year over year, weighed down by heavy spending.\n\n## NASDAQ: AAPL\n\nApple\n\nToday's Change\n\n(4.12%) $10.69\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$270.17\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$4.0T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$259.19- $270.49\n\n52wk Range [...] \u2022By Neil Patel\n\nPrediction: Apple's Dominant Competitive Position Won't Fade in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Age\n\n\u2022By Matt DiLallo\n\nInside My Unique Passive Income Strategy on Apple (And How You Can Easily Mimic it With This ETF)\n\n\u2022By Daniel Sparks\n\nApple vs. Meta Platforms: Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Is a Better Buy Right Now?\n\n\u2022By Eric Trie\n\nStock Market Today, Jan. 30: Apple Advances After Strong Earnings as Focus Turns to Supply and AI\n\n### About the Author [...] Of course, both companies face risks. Berkshire's large cash position, for instance, raises the stakes for its CEO's capital allocation choices this year and beyond. If Abel drops the ball with any major new investments, the stock could stumble. In addition, Apple is a large company that often faces regulatory scrutiny, and its global reach exposes it to geopolitical risks.\n\nOverall, however, I believe these are great investments -- especially when paired together.\n\n## Read Next\n\n\u2022By Howard Smith\n\nStock Market Today, Feb. 2: Apple Stock Jumps After Record Q1 Revenue Boosts Investor Confidence\n\n\u2022By Trevor Jennewine\n\nPalantir Billionaire Peter Thiel Sells Nvidia and Tesla, and Buys 2 AI Stocks That Now Account for 61% of His Portfolio\n\n\u2022By Neil Patel", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.tipranks.com/news/smci-stock-braces-for-q2-earnings-analysts-cautious-options-eye-12-swing", "title": "SMCI Stock Braces for Q2 Earnings \u2013 Analysts Cautious, Options Eye 12% Swing - TipRanks", "score": 0.15203224, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 20:22:00 GMT", "content": "Shalu Saraf3h ago\n\nGOOGL](/news/alphabet-googl-will-report-q4-earnings-on-february-4-here-is-what-to-expect \"GOOGL\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### AI Is Driving Smartphone Prices Higher, and Memory Chipmakers Are the Real Winners\n\nRan Melamed3h ago\n\nMUAAPL](/news/ai-driven-memory-shortage-pushes-smartphone-prices-up-25-in-2026 \"MU | AAPL | DELL | MSFT | NVDA | GOOGL | SSNLF | LNVGY\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### OpenAI Unveils Codex App for Use with Apple (AAPL) Computers\n\nJoel Baglole4h ago\n\nAAPL](/news/openai-unveils-codex-app-for-use-with-apple-aapl-computers \"AAPL\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### Quantum Computing News: Defense Spending, IBM\u2019s Hybrid Push, and Quantum\u2019s First Step Into Wall Street\n\nRan Melamed4h ago [...] Follow Us\n\nOpen App\n\nDownload the TipRanks App\n\nScan the QR code to download the app\n\nGoogle Play\n\nApp Store\n\nLearn more about the TipRanks app >>\n\nOpen App\n\nSign UpSign In\n\nPopular\n\nNVDA\n\nNvidiaAAPL\n\nAppleMSFT\n\nMicrosoft\n\nTrending Stocks\n\nMETA\n\nMeta PlatformsMSFT\n\nMicrosoftNOW\n\nServiceNowINTC\n\nIntelTSLA\n\nTeslaNFLX\n\nNetflix\n\nSign UpLogin\n\nTOOLS\n\nPortfolio\n\nWatchlist\n\nTop Insiders Stocks\n\nPopular\n\nTop Stocks\n\nPopular\n\nMarket Movers\n\nCompare stocks\n\nCompare ETFs\n\nNotification Center\n\nNews\n\nStock Screener\n\nETF Screener\n\nPopular\n\nPenny Stock Screener\n\nTechnical Analysis Screener\n\nTop Analyst Stocks\n\nPopular\n\nTop Smart Score Stocks\n\nPopular\n\nAI Analyst Top Stocks\n\nNew\n\nTop Insiders Stocks\n\nSmart Investor Picks\n\nSmart Dividend\n\nSmart Growth\n\nSmart Value\n\nCompare Stocks\n\nCompare ETFs", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.tipranks.com/news/openai-unveils-codex-app-for-use-with-apple-aapl-computers", "title": "OpenAI Unveils Codex App for Use with Apple (AAPL) Computers - TipRanks", "score": 0.07978202, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 19:40:29 GMT", "content": "## Is AAPL Stock a Buy?\n\nThe stock of Apple has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 30 Wall Street analysts.
