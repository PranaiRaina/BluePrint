It might be paired with Mobile High Bandwidth Memory RAM to boost signal transmission speeds.\n\nThe upcoming iPhone might also be the first Apple cellphone to embrace silicon anode batteries. According to another ETNews report\") from 2025, Apple is looking into using pure silicon anode battery technology for the 20th anniversary iPhone.

More recently, display analyst Ross Young posted\") on X saying that he doesn't expect an all-screen iPhone to be released before 2030. In another post\"), Young said that Face ID components will be \"under a transparent area of the display, resulting in a smaller notch\" on the 2026 and 2027 iPhones. [...] There are conflicting reports regarding the all-screen design for a 2027 iPhone. Apple could shrink the Dynamic Island to a punch-hole cutout (instead of a pill-shaped notch) later this year, and this design could continue in 2027. However, there could be a special 20th-anniversary model (without a display cutout) that would be an ultra-premium model sitting above the iPhone Pro (with a small punch-hole cutout) in Apple's lineup.\n\n## iPhone 20 display, processor and cameras", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/no-design-changes-coming-to-iphone-18/", "title": "No Major Design Changes Coming to iPhone 18 Models, Leaker Claims - MacRumors", "score": 0.32939172, "published_date": "Tue, 03 Feb 2026 16:20:23 GMT", "content": "The \u200ciPhone 18\u200c Pro and \u200ciPhone 18\u200c Pro Max are expected to launch later this year, featuring a smaller Dynamic Island, the C2 modem, a simplified Camera Control, a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, and an upgraded main camera with a variable aperture.

The \u200ciPhone\u200c 12 Pro, 13 Pro, and 14 Pro also largely shared the same design, as did the \u200ciPhone\u200c X, \u200ciPhone\u200c XS, and \u200ciPhone\u200c 11 Pro. Successive generation-over-generation flagship \u200ciPhone\u200c redesigns would be unprecedented, making it highly likely that the \u200ciPhone 18\u200c Pro will look very similar to the device currently on sale. [...] The Weibo user claims that since the iPhone 17 lineup proved to be successful with high sales, the \u200ciPhone 18\u200c models likely won't have major changes to their appearance. Rather than promoting design changes, Apple is apparently likely to heavily emphasize advancements made with the A20 and A20 Pro chip, which will likely be the first 2nm Apple silicon chips.
