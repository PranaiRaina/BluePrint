The iPhone X was the first Apple phone without Touch ID, marked the debut of Face ID and an all-new look with minimal bezels. This design is still echoed in the current iPhone 17 line.

Several Pro models have shared the same look across multiple years, including the iPhone 12 Pro through iPhone 14 Pro and earlier Pro models before that.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro already delivered a notable redesign, which makes another immediate change unlikely. As a result, the iPhone 18 Pro models should look nearly identical to what is on sale today.\n\nWhile the design stays familiar, hardware upgrades will take center stage. Apple is expected to highlight the A20 and A20 Pro chips, which are likely its first 2nm processors. These chips should be the main talking point when the new phones arrive.
