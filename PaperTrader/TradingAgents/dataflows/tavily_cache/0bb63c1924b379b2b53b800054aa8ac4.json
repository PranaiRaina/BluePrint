A spring release is looking more and more unlikely with Mobile World Conference 2026 coming and no sign of an N1 chip in sight. Summer will be late considering the competition. While AMD has new Ryzen AI Max chips built for gaming this year, Intel is the one company leading the pack for both performance and efficiency on its Panther Lake laptops. The gaming performance and battery life we\u2019ve seen from these machines are significantly better than we\u2019ve seen from other laptops at lower power. [...] ## Nvidia\u2019s N1 could miss most of the year\n\nPrevious leaks suggested the N1X may equal that of a modern RTX 5050 GPU at lower wattages. What\u2019s less promising is just how long it could take to get there. Noted leaker Moore\u2019s Law Is Dead published several videos this week to his YouTube channel where he claimed Nvidia could be delaying the launch of its new chips until later, even as late as summer this year.
