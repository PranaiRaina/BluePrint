[...] Nvidia\u2019s 10-Q indicates the following.\n\n Cash & cash equivalents: $11.486 billion (Oct. 26, 2025)\n Marketable securities: $49.122 billion\n Total cash + cash equivalents + marketable securities: $60.608 billion\n Shares outstanding (as of Nov. 14, 2025): 24.3 billion\n\nHuang can claim \u201cthe largest investment we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d and the market pays attention because of his financial sheet.\n\n## Where OpenAI fits: It\u2019s not a \u201cfriendship,\u201d but a demand moat\n\nIn the same results announcement, Nvidia spoke about a strategic relationship with OpenAI.\n\nThe goal is to use at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI\u2019s next-generation AI infrastructure.\n\nThat is not small.\n\nMore Nvidia: [...] From its 10-Q:\n\n Nvidia repurchased 70M shares for $12.6 billion in Q3 FY26.\n Nvidia repurchased 262M shares for $36.7 billion in the first nine months of FY26.\n It was authorized to repurchase up to $62.2 billion more, as of Oct. 26, 2025.\n\nSo here\u2019s the true stock angle. If Nvidia can continue to buy back shares on a large scale while simultaneously supporting the ecosystem, it strengthens the \u201cAI cash engine\u201d story on which the multiple is based.\n\n## What would actually move NVDA stock from here\n\nNVDA stock requires tangible catalysts rather than just positive sentiment.
