(It generally releases its results at 4:20 p.m. ET, in my observation.) An earnings call with analysts is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET the same day.\n\nFor Q4, management guided for revenue of $65 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 65%. It also guided (albeit indirectly, through several inputs) for adjusted EPS of $1.50, representing 69% growth.\n\n## Read Next\n\n\u2022By Stefon Walters\n\nBetter Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir\n\n\u2022By Sean Williams\n\nNvidia and Palantir Are Sending a $12.8 Billion Ominous Warning to Wall Street -- but Are Investors Paying Attention? [...] Avg Vol\n\n3.2M\n\nGross Margin\n\n57.96%\n\nDividend Yield\n\n0.17%\n\nIn Q4, Teradyne's revenue jumped 44% year over year to $1.08 billion, driven by strong demand for its testing equipment for AI-related chips, both compute (the category that includes the GPUs that Nvidia designs) and memory (Nvidia buys memory chips for integration with its GPUs for its AI data center chips). Adjusted EPS soared 89% year over year to $1.80, crushing the $1.38 Wall Street had expected.\n\nCEO Greg Smith said, \"In 2026, we expect year-over-year growth across all of our businesses, with strong momentum in compute driven by AI.\"\n\nTeradyne stock rocketed 13.4% on Tuesday.\n\n## Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings on Feb. 25 [...] Volume\n\n140K\n\nAvg Vol\n\n46M\n\nGross Margin\n\n82.37%\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Palantir's revenue soared 70% year over year to $1.41 billion. Growth was driven by U.S. commercial revenue skyrocketing 137% to $507 million and U.S. government revenue jumping 66% to $570 million. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 79% to 0.25.\n\nMoreover, management provided 2026 revenue guidance of 61% annual growth.\n\nThe quarter's results and guidance easily beat Wall Street's estimates.\n\nPalantir stock jumped 6.8% on Tuesday.\n\n## Teradyne's quarterly results\n\nTeradyne's largest business is making testing equipment for semiconductors (or chips).
