Accounting for about 25% of Apple's fiscal 2025 revenue, this is the company's second-biggest segment after iPhone. Consistently growing at double-digit rates, this high-margin segment should be a catalyst for Apple's earnings growth over the long haul.\n\nIn addition to each of these companies being good investments in their own right, they also offer a good mixture of offense and defense when paired together. [...] But what's great about Apple, however, is more than just its recent results; it's how the tech company is being more cautious about investing in AI compute than many other tech companies right now. This financial discipline is one reason the company posted such strong earnings growth in its most recent quarter. Apple's earnings per share rose 19% year-over-year in fiscal Q1, outpacing social media company Meta Platforms, even though Meta's revenue rose 24% year-over-year during the holiday quarter (much faster than Apple's 16% growth); Meta's earnings rose only 11% year over year, weighed down by heavy spending.\n\n## NASDAQ: AAPL\n\nApple\n\nToday's Change\n\n(4.12%) $10.69\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$270.17\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$4.0T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$259.19- $270.49\n\n52wk Range", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-stock-forecast-bracing-for-a-pullback-amid-ai-headwinds", "title": "Nvidia Stock Forecast: Bracing for a Pullback Amid AI Headwinds -
