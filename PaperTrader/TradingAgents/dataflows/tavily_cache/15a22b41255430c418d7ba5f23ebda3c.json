The lowest in-stock listing we could find was the MSI RTX 5090 Liquid at $3,699, sold by Newegg. Other stores either show no stock at all or list placeholder prices that do not reflect real availability. This has become the normal state rather than a temporary spike.\n\n### Crypto, COVID and AI, new GPUs can\u2019t catch a break\n\nThere is also little reason to expect a late-cycle correction. With next-generation GPUs now expected around mid-2027, the window for prices to settle is short. Demand from the AI sector has not eased, and the market is now dealing with a DRAM shortage crisis that pushes costs in the opposite direction. [...] ## RTX 5090 turns 1, but there\u2019s nothing to celebrate\n\nOne year after launch, the GeForce RTX 5090 is still defined less by performance and more by access. The card sits at the top of the current GPU stack and remains the flagship for this generation. The card wasn\u2019t easily available at launch, and let\u2019s remind our readers the card was pushed back a little. While we have seen plenty of reviewers and influencers with multiple RTX 5090 cards at launch, regular buyers had to wait another few weeks for stock to normalize. But this didn\u2019t last long.

Microsoft is pushing a more PC-like Xbox strategy, and the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally handhelds are the current example of that approach.\n\nSource: AMD\n\n  \n\nFollow us on Google News   Set as Preferred Source \n\nShare\n\n#### Popular Stories", "raw_content": null}], "response_time": 0.89, "request_id": "958bd207-37dd-480d-9f8d-286fa3f9f3aa"}
