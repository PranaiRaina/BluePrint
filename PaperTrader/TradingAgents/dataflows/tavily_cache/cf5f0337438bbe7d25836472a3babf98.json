After walking through a dimly lit corridor into the hangar, rows of tables were neatly set with a hardcover notebook, a pen, a mug (all branded, of course), and a face sheet with portraits of every famous face expected throughout the eight-hour day to showcase Apple\u2019s 2026 offerings. [...] No one had any complaints about the Shrinking panel, which welcomed Harrison Ford to the hangar to discuss working with Michael J. Fox as Gerry, a Parkinson\u2019s patient who meets Paul (Harrison Ford) at their shared doctor\u2019s office. Co-creators Bill Lawrence, Brett Goldstein and Jason Segel were MIA. Not much news out of that one, but to be fair the series did just get renewed for Season 4 ahead of the Season 3 premiere last week.\n\nSpeaking of this crew, nothing on Tuesday from one of Apple\u2019s biggest shows, Ted Lasso, even though that\u2019s slated to return with Season 4 this summer.
