Accounting for about 25% of Apple's fiscal 2025 revenue, this is the company's second-biggest segment after iPhone. Consistently growing at double-digit rates, this high-margin segment should be a catalyst for Apple's earnings growth over the long haul.\n\nIn addition to each of these companies being good investments in their own right, they also offer a good mixture of offense and defense when paired together. [...] But what's great about Apple, however, is more than just its recent results; it's how the tech company is being more cautious about investing in AI compute than many other tech companies right now. This financial discipline is one reason the company posted such strong earnings growth in its most recent quarter. Apple's earnings per share rose 19% year-over-year in fiscal Q1, outpacing social media company Meta Platforms, even though Meta's revenue rose 24% year-over-year during the holiday quarter (much faster than Apple's 16% growth); Meta's earnings rose only 11% year over year, weighed down by heavy spending.\n\n## NASDAQ: AAPL\n\nApple\n\nToday's Change\n\n(4.12%) $10.69\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$270.17\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$4.0T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$259.19- $270.49\n\n52wk Range [...] ## Key Points\n\n Greg Abel's new role as Berkshire Hathaway CEO comes with about $378 billion in cash and Treasury bills.\n Apple's fiscal first-quarter results were driven by a 23% year-over-year jump in iPhone revenue.\n I like the pairing of Apple's strong growth with Berkshire's optionality.\n\n## NASDAQ: AAPL\n\n### Apple\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$4.0T\n\nToday's Change\n\n(4.12%) $10.69\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$270.17\n\nPrice as ofFebruary 2, 2026 at 3:58 PMET\n\nApple's surging iPhone sales and Berkshire's $378 billion cash hoard make a nice pair as an anchor for my portfolio in 2026.", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.tipranks.com/news/openai-unveils-codex-app-for-use-with-apple-aapl-computers", "title": "OpenAI Unveils Codex App for Use with Apple (AAPL) Computers - TipRanks", "score": 0.25538355, "published_date": "Mon, 02 Feb 2026 19:40:29 GMT", "content": "[Premium\n\nFed\u2019s Bostic Dashes Rate Cut Hopes, Projects Zero Cuts in 2026\n\nDIAQQQ](/news/feds-bostic-dashes-rate-cut-hopes-projects-zero-cuts-in-2026 \"DIA | QQQ | SPY\")\n\n[Premium\n\nWWD Earnings: Woodward Stock Jumps 15% on Earnings Beat and Raised Guidance\n\nWWD](/news/wwd-earnings-woodward-stock-jumps-10-on-earnings-beat-and-raised-guidance \"WWD\")\n\nMore News >\n\nEducation\n\nPersonal FinanceHow To Use TipRanksTipRanks LabsGlossaryFAQs\n\nAbout Us\n\nAbout TipRanksContact UsReviewsMobile APP\n\nWorking with TipRanks\n\nEnterprise SolutionsAdvertise with UsTop Online BrokersBecome an AffiliateTipRanks News Wire\n\nFollow Us\n\nOpen App\n\nDownload the TipRanks App\n\nScan the QR code to download the app\n\nGoogle Play\n\nApp Store\n\nLearn more about the TipRanks app >>\n\nOpen App\n\nSign UpSign In\n\nPopular\n\nNVDA [...] Eddie Pan2h ago\n\nDIAQQQ](/news/feds-bostic-dashes-rate-cut-hopes-projects-zero-cuts-in-2026 \"DIA | QQQ | SPY\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### Cantor Expects \u2018Solid Beat\u2019 from Qualcomm\u2019s Q1 Earnings, Here\u2019s Why it Cut QCOM Stock Price Target\n\nSirisha Bhogaraju2h ago\n\nAAPLQCOM](/news/cantor-expects-solid-beat-from-qualcomms-q1-earnings-heres-why-it-cut-qcom-stock-price-target \"AAPL | QCOM | SSNLF\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### Michael Burry Names the Companies He Thinks GameStop Should Acquire\n\nVince Condarcuri2h ago\n\nWADT](/news/michael-burry-names-the-companies-he-thinks-gamestop-should-acquire \"W | ADT | AGO | GME | MAT | MGM | PAG | SFM | BRK.B | SIRI | WYNN\")\n\nMore Market News >\n\n## More Articles\n\nPremiumMarket News\n\nPLTR Earnings: Palantir Stock Jumps after Smashing Revenue and Outlook\n\n38m ago\n\nPLTR [...] Vince Condarcuri1h ago\n\nHOOD](/news/robinhood-stock-plunges-as-crypto-and-prediction-markets-spook-investors \"HOOD\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### Ford Stock (NYSE:F) Slips as NHTSA Probe Expands\n\nSteve Anderson1h ago\n\nF](/news/ford-stock-nysef-slips-as-nhtsa-probe-expands \"F | XIACF\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### Gold Price Crashes \u2014 JPMorgan Sees $6,300 Rally by Year-End\n\nKirti Tak1h ago\n\nJPM](/news/gold-price-crashes-to-4500-jpmorgan-sees-6300-rally-by-year-end \"JPM\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### SMCI Stock Braces for Q2 Earnings \u2013 Analysts Cautious, Options Eye 12% Swing\n\nSheryl Sheth1h ago\n\nSMCI](/news/smci-stock-braces-for-q2-earnings-analysts-cautious-options-eye-12-swing \"SMCI\")\n\n[Premium\n\n### Fed\u2019s Bostic Dashes Rate Cut Hopes, Projects Zero Cuts in 2026\n\nEddie Pan2h ago", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-and-p-500-02032026-11898157", "title": "Stock Market Today: Major Indexes Retreat as Tech Shares Sink;
