Initial reviews broadly praised the visual quality, eye- and hand-tracking accuracy, and technical ambition of the product, while also noting its high price, physical weight, limited battery life, and a comparatively small library of software designed specifically for spatial computing. Following the launch, Apple gradually expanded Vision Pro availability to additional countries and continued to update visionOS with new features in 2024 and 2025. [...] Apple finally revealed the Apple Vision Pro in June 2023 during its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), marking the company's first major new hardware platform announcement since the Apple Watch. In its initial announcement, Apple described Vision Pro as its first \"spatial computer,\" introducing visionOS, a new operating system designed around three-dimensional app windows controlled by eye tracking, hand gestures, and voice input. The device combined dual micro-OLED displays with a total of roughly 23 million pixels, advanced sensor arrays, and custom silicon, including the M2 chip and a dedicated R1 chip for real-time sensor processing. Apple also announced a starting price of $3,499 in the United States and said the product would launch in early 2024. [...] The headset was never expected to be mass-market from day one, according to Apple. Even so, enthusiasm reportedly cooled far faster than anticipated. The latest report on the matter was published earlier this month by the Financial Times, claiming that the Vision Pro is still failing to catch on.\n\nRoughly a year and a half after the initial release, Apple introduced an updated Vision Pro model featuring the M5 chip, representing the first hardware revision of the device. The M5 chip enabled 10% more rendered pixels, a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, better responsiveness, and up to an extra hour of battery life. Apple also introduced a counterweighted Dual Knit Band designed to improve comfort.", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://glassalmanac.com/vision-pro-shift-reveals-new-focus-on-ai-glasses-in-2025-why-it-matters/", "title": "Vision Pro Shift Reveals New Focus On AI Glasses In 2025 \u2013 Why It Matters - Glass Almanac", "score": 0.990732, "published_date": "Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:05:56 GMT", "content": "Apple\u2019s decision matters because it rewrites where engineering budget and talent will flow this year and next, influencing product timelines and partner bets. A pause announced in October 2025 means component redesigns and supplier orders tied to a Vision Pro overhaul are likely delayed, giving rivals a clear opening to push cheaper, lighter AR glasses. For developers, that changes priorities: invest in lightweight spatial apps or keep optimizing for a high-end headset with limited reach? The practical effect is a near-term tilt toward software-driven differentiation rather than another expensive hardware refresh.\n\n## Which sales figures and dates show why Vision Pro needs a pivot in 2025 [...] Apple launched Vision Pro at $3,499, and subsequent software pushes-like visionOS 26-aimed to boost value but didn\u2019t erase adoption barriers. Media coverage through mid-2025 showed slow consumer traction, prompting Apple to prioritize smaller, AI-enabled glasses. The strategic shift leans on software (Apple Intelligence) rather than aggressive hardware upgrades.\n\nSee also  \"Smart Move, Just Late\" Sparks Alarm Over 30% Metaverse Cuts In 2025 - Here's Why\n\n## The numbers that change the game for Vision Pro in 2025\n\n| KPI | Value + Unit | Change/Impact |\n --- \n| Launch price | $3,499 | Limited consumer uptake vs mass-market devices |\n| Overhaul pause date | Oct 1, 2025 | Resources redirected toward AI glasses |\n| visionOS update | April 2025 | Apple Intelligence added, software focus grew | [...] ## What changes for developers and buyers after Apple\u2019s 2025 pivot\n\n> \u2022 Apple paused the Vision Pro overhaul on Oct 1, 2025; resources moved to AI glasses.\n>\n> \u2022 visionOS 26 added Apple Intelligence in April 2025; software updates increased Vision Pro capabilities.\n>\n> \u2022 Bloomberg and Reuters reported the pause; enterprise roadmap now prioritizes compact AR products.\n\n## Why Apple\u2019s 2025 Vision Pro shift accelerates the race to AR glasses", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-sports-now-supports-golf-and-more/", "title": "Apple Sports Now Supports Golf and More - MacRumors", "score": 0.019870713, "published_date": "Wed, 04 Feb 2026 12:59:25 GMT", "content": "Tuesday February 3, 2026 8:55 am PST by Joe Rossignol\n\nIn 2022, Apple introduced a new Apple Home architecture that is \"more reliable and efficient,\" and the deadline to upgrade and avoid issues is fast approaching.
