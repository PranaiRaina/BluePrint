Adjusted EPS soared 89% year over year to $1.80, crushing the $1.38 Wall Street had expected.\n\nCEO Greg Smith said, \"In 2026, we expect year-over-year growth across all of our businesses, with strong momentum in compute driven by AI.\"\n\nTeradyne stock rocketed 13.4% on Tuesday.\n\n## Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings on Feb. 25", "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2026/02/03/can-ai-demand-drive-nvda-stock-to-240/", "title": "Can AI Demand Drive NVDA Stock To $240? - Forbes", "score": 0.5084226, "published_date": "Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:11:28 GMT", "content": "PROMOTED\n\nLet\u2019s delve into details of each of the assessed factors, but before that, for quick background: With $4.5 Tril in market capitalization, NVIDIA provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions for the gaming, visualization, datacenter, and automotive industries globally, with a strategic partnership with Kroger Co.\n\n Valuation Appears Very High\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Bill Clinton And Hillary Clinton Agree To Testify On Jeffrey Epstein After Rejecting Subpoenas\n\n### WWE Raw Results (Feb. 2, 2026), Winners, Highlights And Grades, Winners, Highlights And Grades\")\n\n### Another Daytime Exit: \u2018Sherri,\u2019 Hosted By Sherri Shepherd, To End Syndication Run\n\nThis table illustrates how NVDA is valued compared to the broader market.
