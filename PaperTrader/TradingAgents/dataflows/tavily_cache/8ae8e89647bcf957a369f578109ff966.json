This financial discipline is one reason the company posted such strong earnings growth in its most recent quarter. Apple's earnings per share rose 19% year-over-year in fiscal Q1, outpacing social media company Meta Platforms, even though Meta's revenue rose 24% year-over-year during the holiday quarter (much faster than Apple's 16% growth); Meta's earnings rose only 11% year over year, weighed down by heavy spending.\n\n## NASDAQ: AAPL\n\nApple\n\nToday's Change\n\n(4.12%) $10.69\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$270.17\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$4.0T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$259.19- $270.49\n\n52wk Range [...] $4.0T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$259.19- $270.49\n\n52wk Range\n\n$169.21- $288.62\n\nVolume\n\n3.1M\n\nAvg Vol\n\n47M\n\nGross Margin\n\n47.33%\n\nDividend Yield\n\n0.38%\n\nAnd then there's Apple's services segment, which commanded a gross profit margin of 75.4% for fiscal 2025, towering over its products segment's 36.8% gross margin for the same period. Accounting for about 25% of Apple's fiscal 2025 revenue, this is the company's second-biggest segment after iPhone. Consistently growing at double-digit rates, this high-margin segment should be a catalyst for Apple's earnings growth over the long haul.\n\nIn addition to each of these companies being good investments in their own right, they also offer a good mixture of offense and defense when paired together.
